## Organizations

Tenants in izIAM are named 'Organizations'. Each organization may have one to many non-overlapping validity periods.

### Creating a new organization

To act as the organization manager of your own organization, it is enough for you to:

- first, signup with izIAM,
- second, on whatever order is most easy for you:

    a. make your email address verified,
    b. create a new organization template.

As the creator, you will be automagically enroled as this new organization manager, with all capabilities that this role gives.

The newly created organization holds very suitable default value for the main aspects of an OpenID/OAuth-compatible identity provider. But you still have to:

- name it, giving it a label which uniquely distinguish it,
- set up your base root URL, which must also be unique.

Both these two values, the name and the base root URL, are identifiers or your organization. From a human point of view, the name is like the brand of an enterprise, and it must be clear for your end-user who you are when izIAM presents a dialog on behalf your organization with this name. From machine and application clients point of view, the base root URL directly points to your own organization.

Though those two values may both be modified later, we want advise you to be very cautionous with that as changing a widely distributed identifier is never a very good idea, and must be driven with great caution.

### Setting up an organization

An organization is build around:

- an OAuth server configuration
- authorized client applications
- registered identities

### Managing several organizations

izIAM let you create as many organizations as you are able to manage. A frequent use case is to have a production organization, and some other smaller ones for development, tests and pre-production environments.

Actually izIAM team advises and encourages you to do so in order not to mix production and non-production data in a same environment.

## Clients

A client in izIAM can be a native app that executes on a mobile device, a single-page web app that executes on a browser, or a regular web application that executes on a server, as well as an API you are developing and you want make its use more secure.

When you create a client in your izIAM Dashboard, a client ID as an alphanumeric string is automatically issued for this client in this organization. This is the unique identifier for your client. You will use this ID in your application or API code when you call izIAM APIs. This identifier is not modifiable, not secret.

Another important piece of information is the client secret. It must be kept confidential at all times. If anyone gains access to your client secret, then they can impersonate your application and access protected resources. It is important that you select the correct client type to help izIAM check for certain security risks.

### Identities

Identities for each organization are stored in a accounts-like collection: 'identities'

### Authentification providers

### Authorization providers

The roles-based authorization provider stores its data in 'authorizations'.

what is a user identification service?
ChatGPT
A User Identification Service, often referred to as a User ID service or simply a User Service, is a component of identity and access management (IAM) systems or platforms. Its primary function is to manage and maintain information about user identities within an organization's IT infrastructure. This service plays a fundamental role in ensuring that users can securely and efficiently access the resources and systems they need while maintaining appropriate security measures.

Key aspects and functionalities of a User Identification Service typically include:

User Identity Management: This service stores and manages user profiles and their associated attributes, including usernames, email addresses, contact information, and other relevant details. It serves as a centralized repository for user data.

Authentication: User Identification Services often include authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of users when they attempt to access systems, applications, or resources. This may involve username and password authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometric authentication, or other methods.

User Provisioning: User IDs are created, modified, and deactivated through user provisioning processes. When new employees join an organization or when employees change roles, the User Identification Service helps automate the provisioning and deprovisioning of user accounts and access permissions.

User Self-Service: Many User Identification Services offer self-service features, allowing users to manage their own profiles, reset passwords, update contact information, and sometimes request additional access permissions without IT assistance.

User Roles and Permissions: These services often support role-based access control (RBAC), which allows organizations to define roles with specific sets of permissions. Users are assigned to roles, simplifying access management.

Directory Integration: Integration with directories like LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or Microsoft Active Directory is common. This ensures that user information is synchronized across systems and maintained consistently.

Access Control: The service may enforce access control policies, ensuring that users only access resources and applications for which they are authorized. It may also enforce security policies, such as password complexity requirements and expiration rules.

Auditing and Logging: User Identification Services often maintain logs and audit trails of user activities, authentication events, and access changes. These logs are critical for security monitoring and compliance.

Scalability and High Availability: To support organizations of varying sizes, these services must be scalable and designed for high availability to minimize downtime.

Security: Security measures such as encryption, secure communication protocols, and protection against unauthorized access are essential components of User Identification Services.

APIs and Integration: Many User Identification Services offer APIs and connectors that allow integration with other applications and systems, enabling organizations to build custom solutions and workflows.

Compliance and Governance: These services may provide tools and features to help organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements by enforcing access controls, permissions, and audit capabilities.

Overall, a User Identification Service is a critical component within an organization's identity and access management infrastructure, enabling the secure and efficient management of user identities, access permissions, and authentication processes across various systems and resources.
