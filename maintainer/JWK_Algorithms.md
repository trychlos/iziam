## Encryption Algorithms for EC Key Type

1. ECDH-ES (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static)
Use Case: This is a key agreement algorithm that derives a shared secret using elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman. The shared secret is then used with a symmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt the actual data.
Notes: ECDH-ES itself doesn't perform encryption; it is typically used in conjunction with a symmetric encryption algorithm like AES.

2. ECDH-ES+A128KW (ECDH-ES using Concat KDF and AES Key Wrap with 128-bit key)
Use Case: Combines ECDH key agreement with AES Key Wrap (128-bit key) to securely wrap an encryption key.
Notes: Provides a balance between security and performance.

3. ECDH-ES+A192KW (ECDH-ES using Concat KDF and AES Key Wrap with 192-bit key)
Use Case: Similar to ECDH-ES+A128KW, but uses a 192-bit key for the AES Key Wrap, providing higher security.

4. ECDH-ES+A256KW (ECDH-ES using Concat KDF and AES Key Wrap with 256-bit key)
Use Case: Uses a 256-bit key for the AES Key Wrap, offering the highest level of security among the ECDH-based encryption algorithms.

## Encryption Algorithms for RSA Key Type

1. RSA-OAEP (RSAES OAEP using default parameters)
Use Case: RSA-OAEP is a widely used algorithm for encrypting data, providing better security than the older RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5. It uses Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) to prevent certain types of cryptographic attacks.
Hash Algorithm: Typically uses SHA-1 by default, but SHA-256 is recommended for stronger security.

2. RSA-OAEP-256 (RSAES OAEP using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256)
Use Case: This variant of RSA-OAEP uses SHA-256 for both the hash function and the mask generation function (MGF1), offering stronger security than the default RSA-OAEP.

3. RSA-OAEP-384 (RSAES OAEP using SHA-384 and MGF1 with SHA-384)
Use Case: Provides even stronger security than RSA-OAEP-256 by using SHA-384. This is suitable for applications that require a high level of security.

4. RSA-OAEP-512 (RSAES OAEP using SHA-512 and MGF1 with SHA-512)
Use Case: The most secure RSA encryption option, using SHA-512. It is typically used when maximum security is needed.

5. RSA1_5 (RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5)
Use Case: This is an older encryption scheme using PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. While it's still supported for compatibility, it's generally not recommended for new applications due to known vulnerabilities. RSA-OAEP is preferred.

## Encryption Algorithms for oct Key Type

Symmetric Encryption Algorithms (Combined with EC or RSA Key Agreement)
After the key agreement or key wrapping step with EC or RSA, a symmetric encryption algorithm is typically used to encrypt the actual data:

1. A128GCM (AES GCM with 128-bit key)
Fast, secure, and widely supported.

2. A192GCM (AES GCM with 192-bit key)
Offers stronger security than A128GCM with a slightly larger key size.

3. A256GCM (AES GCM with 256-bit key)
Provides the highest level of security among AES-GCM options.

4. A128CBC-HS256 (AES CBC with HMAC-SHA256)
Provides authenticated encryption with a 128-bit key and a SHA-256 HMAC for integrity.

5. A192CBC-HS384 (AES CBC with HMAC-SHA384)
Similar to A128CBC-HS256 but with a 192-bit key and SHA-384 HMAC.

6. A256CBC-HS512 (AES CBC with HMAC-SHA512)
Uses a 256-bit key with SHA-512 HMAC for maximum security.

Key Points
EC Key Type: Primarily used in combination with key agreement algorithms (like ECDH-ES) and symmetric encryption.
RSA Key Type: Primarily used for key wrapping and direct encryption, with RSA-OAEP being the recommended choice over RSA1_5.
Symmetric Algorithms: Often used in combination with the key agreement or key wrapping to perform the actual data encryption.
These algorithms are standardized by the IETF and are widely supported in various libraries and tools that handle JWKs and JWTs.

## Signature Algorithms for EC Key Type

When generating a JSON Web Key (JWK) for a signature using the Elliptic Curve (EC) key type, the following algorithms are commonly used:

1. ES256 (ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256)
Curve: P-256 (also known as secp256r1 or prime256v1)
Hash Algorithm: SHA-256
Use Case: This is a widely used algorithm for compact and efficient signatures. It provides a good balance between security and performance.

2. ES384 (ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384)
Curve: P-384 (also known as secp384r1)
Hash Algorithm: SHA-384
Use Case: Offers stronger security than ES256 with a slight performance trade-off, suitable for applications needing higher security.

3. ES512 (ECDSA using P-521 and SHA-512)
Curve: P-521 (also known as secp521r1)
Hash Algorithm: SHA-512
Use Case: Provides the highest security level among the commonly used elliptic curves, though it is less common due to its larger key size and reduced performance.

4. EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
Curve: Ed25519 or Ed448
Hash Algorithm: Depends on the specific curve (e.g., SHA-512 for Ed25519)
Use Case: Offers high performance and security, particularly with the Ed25519 curve, which is designed for high-speed operations and resistance against side-channel attacks.

Key Points:
The choice of algorithm (ES256, ES384, ES512, or EdDSA) depends on your application's security requirements and performance considerations.
When generating the JWK, you'll specify the curve (crv) and key type (kty). For instance, for ES256, the kty would be EC and the crv would be P-256.
Each of these algorithms is supported by various libraries and tools that handle JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and related cryptographic operations.
These algorithms are standardized by the IETF and are widely supported in JWT libraries across different programming languages.

## Signature Algorithms for RSA Key Type

When generating a JSON Web Key (JWK) for a signature using the RSA key type, the following algorithms are commonly used:

1. RS256 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256)

Use Case: This is the most widely used algorithm for RSA signatures in JWT. It offers a good balance between security and compatibility and is broadly supported in various libraries.

2. RS384 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-384)
Hash Algorithm: SHA-384
Use Case: Provides stronger security than RS256, with a slightly larger output size. It's suitable for applications needing higher security, albeit with slightly higher computational cost.

3. RS512 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512)
Hash Algorithm: SHA-512
Use Case: Offers the highest level of security among the RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 algorithms, with the trade-off of increased computational overhead and larger signature size.

4. PS256 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256)
Hash Algorithm: SHA-256
Mask Generation Function (MGF1): Based on SHA-256
Use Case: Provides a more secure padding scheme than RS256, mitigating some potential vulnerabilities of PKCS#1 v1.5. This is recommended for new applications requiring RSA signatures.

5. PS384 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 and MGF1 with SHA-384)
Hash Algorithm: SHA-384
Mask Generation Function (MGF1): Based on SHA-384
Use Case: Similar to PS256, but with a stronger hash function, offering higher security for applications needing it.

6. PS512 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 and MGF1 with SHA-512)
Hash Algorithm: SHA-512
Mask Generation Function (MGF1): Based on SHA-512
Use Case: Provides the highest level of security among RSA-PSS algorithms, suitable for applications where security is the primary concern.

Key Points:
RSA Key Type (kty: "RSA"): For all these algorithms, the key type in the JWK will be RSA.
Key Size: RSA keys are typically 2048 bits or 3072 bits for general use. For very high security, 4096 bits may be used, but this increases the computational cost.
Algorithm Selection: RS256 is the most commonly used due to its compatibility and balance between security and performance. However, PS256 and its variants (PS384, PS512) are generally recommended for new implementations because of their improved security properties.
These algorithms are widely supported across different JWT libraries and can be used to generate RSA-based JWKs for signing tokens securely.

## Signature Algorithms for oct Key Type

1. HS256 (HMAC using SHA-256)
Use Case: Uses the HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) algorithm with SHA-256 as the hash function. It is widely used for token signing (like JWT) due to its balance of security and performance.

2. HS384 (HMAC using SHA-384)
Use Case: Similar to HS256, but with SHA-384 for the hash function, offering stronger security at the cost of slightly reduced performance.

3. HS512 (HMAC using SHA-512)
Use Case: Uses SHA-512 for the hash function, providing the highest level of security among the HMAC options, with the trade-off of higher computational cost.

Key Points
Key Type (kty): oct refers to symmetric keys used in these algorithms.
Symmetric Encryption: Involves algorithms like AES in GCM or CBC mode combined with HMAC for authenticated encryption.
Symmetric Signing: Uses HMAC with various hash functions (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) for message authentication and integrity.
